In the beginning of the study, I think I had the word barely, and I just based it on how far away the spinner was from the next color. So, on the times where the spinner was close to the next color on the 3 I put a 6. I also put a 6 for every answer on the 18 (I think) because the distance to the next color appeared to be the same as in the ""close calls"" on the 3. For lucky, I just tried to make my answer reflect the probability of landing on a certain spot.
